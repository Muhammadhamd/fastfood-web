                        <h3>
                            <p>Chicken, (Gallus gallus), any of more than 60 breeds of medium-sized poultry that are
                                primarily
                                descended from the wild red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus, family Phasianidae, order
                                Galliformes)
                                of India. The chicken is perhaps the most widely domesticated fowl, raised worldwide for
                                its
                                meat and eggs.
                                Despite the chicken’s close relationship with the red jungle fowl, there is evidence
                                that the
                                gray jungle fowl (G. sonneratii) of southern India and other jungle fowl species, also
                                members
                                of Gallus, may have contributed to the bird’s ancestry. There is some debate about what
                                the
                                chicken’s scientific name should be. Although many taxonomists and ornithologists
                                consider it as
                                a domesticated form of the wild red jungle fowl, some classify it as a subspecies of the
                                red
                                jungle fowl (i.e., G. gallus domesticus), whereas others, including the U.S. Department
                                of
                                Agriculture, classify the bird as G. domesticus.

                                    <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus).

                                        In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them.
                                        Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the
                                        quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed
                                        meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States,
                                        Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.

                                        Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can
                                        be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or
                                        minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin
                                        B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an
                                        increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when
                                        processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of
                                        deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural
                                        product.

                                            <p>sushi, a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of cooked rice
                                                flavoured with vinegar and a variety of vegetable, egg, or raw seafood
                                                garnishes and served cold. Restaurants specializing in sushi abound in
                                                Japan, where subtleties of preparation find a discriminating clientele,
                                                and the dish has gained popularity in the United States and elsewhere
                                                (see also sashimi).
                                                Nigiri-zushi is a hand-formed oblong of rice topped with sliced raw
                                                seafood and a dab of wasabi (a green paste made of true wasabi or
                                                horseradish); the ingredients of oshi-zushi are pressed to shape in a
                                                mold. For maki-zushi, a sheet of nori (laver, a seaweed) is spread with
                                                rice, then with seafood or vegetables and garnishes. The whole is rolled
                                                into a cylinder and sliced. In chirashi-zushi, a homestyle version, the
                                                ingredients are not formed, rather the vinegared rice is strewn with
                                                toppings and garnishes. Vinegar-pickled ginger root (sūshoga) is a
                                                traditional palate-clearing accompaniment to sushi.
